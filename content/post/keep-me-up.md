***Keep Me Up*** is a simple widget to hold the wake lock on your device's screen so it doesn't turn off while you read, or for any other reason one can come up with.

**IMPORTANT:** Keeping your screen on for a long time drains your battery, so make sure you turn it off the moment it's not needed anymore.

Following are some screenshots of the widget:
